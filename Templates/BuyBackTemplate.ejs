                    The Buyback Program can be canceled by the Customer only upon
                    the failure of RAAM to offer the customer's desired value of
                    Buyback on their MG car. Upon such cancellation, the customer
                    will be refunded the amount paid at the time of purchase of
                    the Buyback Program from Raam, excluding the GST amount paid.
                    However, the following conditions must be fulfilled to be
                    eligible for a refund:

                        given to RAAM. This means getting the MG car evaluated by
                        Raam is mandatory. If RAAM denies the customer’s desired
                        value via an official email, the customer is free to sell
                        the car elsewhere.

                        provided by the customer to RAAM within 3 months from the
